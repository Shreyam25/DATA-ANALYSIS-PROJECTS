 US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis \
 Project name :- US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis
 The kaggle platform helped me locate a dataset containing detailed data on accidents in the United States.
 During my analysis, I carefully analyzed the datasets and looked for hidden insights.

###### I drew the following conclusions from my analysis :
1. The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially
2. On weekends , most of the accidents happens in midnight and in *evening * time(probably people in a hurry to get to work)
3. On weekdays , accidents happens in a morning time and in evening time
4. With every passing year, the number of accidents are increaseing.
5. Over 1500 cities have reported just one accident (need to investigate)
